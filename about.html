        <p><div class="lol">Prim was created to people find the best food possible. Yelp on the other hand does not want you to find the best food. They want you to eat at any business that pays them. They blackmail small business into paying them to show good reviews because if the businesses don’t Yelp will only show the negative reviews. My uncle owns a restaurant called Johnny’s Diner and he was complaining about how Yelp was writing fake reviews and pressuring him into paying them for good reviews. He asked “Why can’t there be a website that shows the best restaurants for the best food not the most money?” I brought this idea to my coding class and we created Prim. We aimed for Prim to be mostly controlled by the users, who would be rating the reviews.
